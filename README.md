## The purpose of this project is as follows:
This program procedurally subsets pandas dataframe in a way that is useful for abstracting away from the syntax.
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
I have several data-related tasks that emand reams and reams of Pandas in order to arrive at data of the riht size, shape, type, composition, etc. If I can pass a single line to do that rather than repeating myself, that is a clearly preferable option.
## This project leverages the following libraries:
pandas
## This project does not require any special setup steps.

## The expected frequency for running this code is as follows:
As Needed
